* [OpenGFX (graphics)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opengfx)
* Transport Tycoon Deluxe data files can be installed if you own the Transport Tycoon Deluxe CD

Sound and music sets are recommended (but not necessary). [OpenSFX (sound)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/opensfx), and [OpenMSX (music)](http://dev.openttdcoop.org/projects/openmsx) can be installed via the installer or - if you own the CD -  also the Transport Tycoon Deluxe sound and music.

Additional graphics, sound and music sets can be downloaded via the ingame content download manager.
